# Overview
During the past few years, our company has experienced a high volume of customer increase.
As a financial advisor of an investment firm, we need an algorithm system to catch up the stock trading speed.
Traditional trading tools have many defects, so this time we are going to build a machine learning system, especially the models which implement neural network.
This will maintain our corporationâ€™s competitive advantage in the market.
